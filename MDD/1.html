          <p>The stimulant for this project is a sheet of blank paper. I got my inspirations from a viral youtube video called “A Magaine is an Ipad That Does Not Work”. Many people have believed that paper is going away in the digital age and perhaps it doesn’t match the expectations for today’s digital natives. I decided to create something interactive with the paper - a jumping paper frog. For the class I also created a simple Processing simulation. Based on some feedback on class I later made a game which color track the paper frog which allows the player to play the game by interacting with the paper frog.</p>

          <p>This is one of the earliest project from this class. We were supposed to create a visual response stimulated by a cleome pod, a slinky, and one of the feedback that we received in class. </p>
          <p>This project teaches me sometimes to do the thinking by making and generating a spontaneous response. It was a reversed process for me since I am used to planning before making. From my experiment, I found out that vulnerability is relative, although a steel system like slinky can be longer lasting than a small living cleome pod, once its destroyed the system dies. But when a living organism dies, the seeds can still continue the cycle of life.</p>
